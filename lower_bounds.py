class CircuitLowerBound:
    """
    A class to explore and establish circuit complexity lower bounds
    for Boolean functions. It includes methods to construct functions
    that are hard to compute by small circuits and to formally prove
    lower bounds for certain restricted circuit classes.

        """
        Proves that computing the parity function on n variables requires

        Parameters:
        n (int): The number of input variables.

        Returns:
        str: A statement of the lower bound for parity in the given setting.
