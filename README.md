README: Second-Layer Python-Based Research Language
This project provides a second-layer programming language built on top of Python. It is designed to assist researchers in exploring computational complexity problems, particularly those related to P vs NP. By offering a simplified, more expressive syntax and a robust backend library, it streamlines the process of modeling, analyzing, and testing computational hypotheses.

Introduction
This second-layer programming language is a research-oriented tool for quickly prototyping and testing computational theories. It abstracts away much of Python’s boilerplate syntax, enabling researchers to focus on high-level logic and structure. Built-in integration with a sophisticated Python library further enhances its capabilities, making it easier to perform reductions, analyze proofs, and run experiments.

Key Features
Simplified Syntax: Custom shorthand commands and handlers that reduce boilerplate and increase clarity.
Built-in Support for Complexity Analysis: Direct interfaces to functions for verifying NP certificates, exploring circuit lower bounds, and more.
Integrated Experimentation Framework: Easily run computational experiments, analyze SAT instances, and visualize complexity results.
Code Generation: Translate second-layer language commands into native Python for execution or debugging.
Customizable and Extensible: Users can define their own syntax handlers, add new built-ins, and extend the language’s functionality without deep knowledge of the core codebase.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
A working Python environment with pip installed
Installation
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/second-layer-lang.git
cd second-layer-lang
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Language Interpreter
To run your second-layer code, first create a .slp file containing your commands. For example, example.slp might contain:

plaintext
Copy
SET x 42
PRINT x
Then, run the interpreter:

bash
Copy
python -m core_language example.slp
Core Components
core_language.py
This module handles:

Parsing the second-layer language’s syntax
Dispatching commands to appropriate handlers
Managing the execution environment
You can run commands like:

plaintext
Copy
SET counter 0
LOOP 10 INCREMENT counter
PRINT counter
And the interpreter will parse, dispatch, and execute each command in sequence.

builtin_functions.py
This module defines built-in language functions, including:

loop(times, function): Runs a function a specified number of times.
condition(test, true_block, false_block): A conditional structure.
standard_print(*args): Outputs values to the console.
custom_syntax_handlers.py
This module allows you to register new keywords and their behaviors. For example:

python
Copy
handler = SyntaxHandler()
handler.register_handler("INCREMENT", lambda var: environment[var] += 1)
handler.handle("INCREMENT", "counter")
integration_with_library.py
Directly interfaces the second-layer language with the research library. For example:

Call complex SAT solvers with a single command.
Analyze circuit properties and retrieve results for further processing.
code_generation.py
This module converts second-layer code into standard Python code. For example, the command:

plaintext
Copy
LOOP 5 PRINT "Hello"
Might translate to:

python
Copy
for _ in range(5):
    print("Hello")
Example Usage
Simple Script

Create test.slp:

plaintext
Copy
SET x 10
PRINT x
LOOP 3 PRINT "Repeating"
Run it:

bash
Copy
python -m core_language test.slp
Integration with Library

Use commands like RUN_SAT_SOLVER formula.cnf or ANALYZE_CIRCUIT circuit.json directly in your second-layer code. This enables seamless testing and analysis within the language’s simplified syntax.

Testing
We include a comprehensive test suite in language_tests.py to ensure that:

All commands are parsed correctly
Built-in functions behave as intended
The integration with the research library is seamless
Run tests using:

bash
Copy
python -m unittest discover
