    Simulates running a SAT solver on random 3-CNF formulas.
    For demonstration, this is a placeholder that just outputs random results.

    Parameters:
    num_vars (int): Number of variables in the formula.
    num_clauses (int): Number of clauses in the formula.

    Returns:

    Runs multiple SAT solver experiments and collects data on solve times.

    Parameters:
    num_instances (int): Number of instances to analyze.

    Returns:
    list: Simulated solve times for each instance.
